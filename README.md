Methodology:
1.	Segregate the data of all birds.  
2.	For each bird:  
i.	Find the buffer of all points and join them  
ii.	Take only the Dissolved Buffer with a threshold area  
iii.	Extract all the points from the buffers in (ii)  
iv.	Calculate the Minimum Bounding Geometry for the points from (iii)  
3.	Calculate the difference in territory (Minimum Bounding Geometry) based on:  
i.	Gender  
ii.	Seasons (is possible)  
4.	Effect of Landcover on Territory.
